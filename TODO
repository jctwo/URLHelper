Tasks to do before it's finished:
* Split the URL expansion into a separate app (so that the main app doesn't
need internet permissions).

* Move URL expansion to a separate thread (free with above split to other app?)
so that it doesn't block the UI.

* Implement the handler preferences (current preferred scheme - store a
chosen default for every distinct set of available handlers)

* Create an icon

* Various tidy-ups.

* Work out how to display the add time/date field in a sensible way in the
list.  This looks useful:

* SimpleCursorAdapter constructor is deprecated according to the documentation,
so investigate other options.
