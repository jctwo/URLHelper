Tasks to do before it's finished:
* Split the URL expansion into a separate app (so that the main app doesn't
need internet permissions).

* Move URL expansion to a separate thread (free with above split to other app?)
so that it doesn't block the UI.

* Improve the handler preferences:
  - allow turning off default
  - allow removing stored defaults
  - do custom dialog

* Create an icon

* Various tidy-ups.

* SimpleCursorAdapter constructor is deprecated according to the documentation,
so investigate other options.

* Add details view for a URL (to show original, etc.)

* Add "URL opened" field (with icon?) to list.

* Handle https fully

* Fix problem with relative URIs

* Sort newest at top?

* Fix "database not closed" issues.

* Accept "Share" intents?
